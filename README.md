# Machine Learning Approaches to Understanding DNA Methylation in Cancers

**Authors**: Sam Coleman and Jacob Tye

## Overview

This project explores the application of machine learning techniques to DNA methylation data from The Cancer Genome Atlas (TCGA) and cBioPortal.  
The primary objectives are:

- **Tumor Classification**: Distinguish between normal and tumor samples using methylation profiles.
- **Breast Cancer Subtype Classification**: Identify breast cancer subtypes based on methylation data.

## Data Sources

The analyses utilize publicly available data:

- **TCGA**: Comprehensive genomic and clinical data across various cancer types.
- **cBioPortal**: An open platform for exploring multidimensional cancer genomics data.

Data preparation scripts are located in the [`analysis/data_prep`](./analysis/data_prep) directory.

## Methodology

### Tumor Classification

1.1 **Local Linear Embedding with Logistic Regression**  

- Implementation: [`analysis/01_1_dim_red_prediction.ipynb`](./analysis/01_1_dim_red_prediction.ipynb)

1.2 **Principal Component Analysis with Gradient Boosting**  

- Implementation: [TO UPDATE](./analysis/TO_UPDATE)

Both models achieved over 97% accuracy on the testing dataset.

### Breast Cancer Subtype Classification

2.1 **Unsupervised**:  
K-Means clustering, resulting in a normalized mutual information (NMI) score of 0.2902.  

- Implementation: [`analysis/02_1_kmeans_clustering.ipynb`](./analysis/02_1_kmeans_clustering.ipynb)

2.2 **Supervised**:  
Neural network following feature dimensionality reduction, achieving an NMI score of 0.58.  

- Implementation: [TO UPDATE](./analysis/TO_UPDATE)

## Results

The models effectively differentiate tumors from normal cells, indicating the potential of integrating methylation data with machine learning for early detection and diagnosis.  
The lower performance in subtype classification suggests epigenetic heterogeneity within current categorization systems, highlighting opportunities for refinement.
